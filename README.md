Elemental
==========

Elemental is a simple front-end library that lets you build reactive UIs declaratively using plain JavaScript. No special syntax to learn or complex frameworks to build around, just normal nested functions.

Here's a quick example of what Elemental does:
```javascript
import { Reactor, ob, el } from '@fynyky/elemental'

const rx = new Reactor({ name: 'Anakin' })

el(document.body,
  el('main',
    el('h1', 'Hello World!'),
    el('h2', (x) => { x.id ='foo' }, () => 'returned text'),
    el('defaults to div', ['this', 'is', 'an', 'array']),
    el('p more class names', ob(() => ('My name is ' + rx.name)))
  )
)
// <main class="main">
//   <h1 class="h1">Hello World!</h1>
//   <h2 class="h2" id="foo">returned text</h2>
//   <div class="defaults to div">thisisanarray</div>
//   <p class="p more class names">My name is Anakin</p>
// </main>

rx.name = 'Darth'
//   <p class="p more class names">My name is Anakin</p>
// Changes to
//   <p class="p more class names">My name is Darth</p>
```
- `el` is a function that creates elements then attaches children to them
  - The first argument is the type of element to create (or an existing element to reuse)
  - Subsequent arguments are appended as children
  - Functions are run given their parent, and their return values are appended
  - `Observer` functions do the same, but their children get replaced when updated
- `ob` is shorthand for `new Observer`
- An `Observer` is a function that automatically tracks reactive variables that it uses, and retriggers if they get updated.
- A `Reactor` is an object that stores reactive variables
- When a `Reactor` is updated it automatically retriggers the dependent `Observer` functions

Elemental is designed to be unobtrusive and unopinionated. 
- No special syntax to learn. Everything is just plain JavaScript
- No need to manually declare listeners. Elemental automatically keeps track of all that
- No complex framework internals to debug. Its just appending elements and rerunning observers when needed
- Use it for the whole front-end or just a few components. Elements created by Elemental are just normal DOM elements, and any variable can be easily replaced with a reactive one without changing the rest of your codebase.

Elemental is a reactive UI layer built on top of [Reactor.js](https://github.com/fynyky/reactor.js)

Installation
------------

Elemental is [available on npm](https://npmjs.org/package/@fynyky/elemental). Install it by running:
```
$ npm install @fynyky/elemental
```

Import it using:
```javascript
import  { 
  el,
  ob,
  attr,
  bind,
  Reactor,
  Observer,
  hide,
  batch,
  shuck
}  from '@fynyky/elemental'
```

It is also available directly from [unpkg](unpkg.com). You can import it in javascript using
```javascript
import { el, attr, bind, ob, Reactor, Observer, hide, batch, shuck } from 'https://unpkg.com/@fynyky/elemental'
```


Elements
--------
The function `el(description, children...)` builds DOM elements. It appends the `children` arguments to a parent element created/referenced by the `description`.

The `description` can be a `String` or an existing `Element`. If given a `String` it creates a new `Element` whose classes are the entire description, and the tag type is the first word of the description.

```javascript
el('h1 foo bar')
```
```html
<h1 class="h1 foo bar"></h1>
```

If the first word is not a valid HTML tag it defaults to making a div

```javascript
el('foo bar')
```
```html
<div class="foo bar"></div>
```

If given an existing `Element` it does nothing on its own but uses the provided element as a target for applying the `children` arguments. For example you can append things to the document body by doing
```javascript
el(document.body, 'hello world')
```
```html
<html>
  <body>hello world</body>
</html>
```

For convenience, if the string provided starts with `#` or `.` then instead of creating a new element, the description will be used as a [selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Locating_DOM_elements_using_selectors) and will try to find an existing matching element in the document.

```javascript
el('#foo') // Finds an element with id="foo"
el('.bar') // Finds an element whose classes contain "bar"
```

This is admittedly a bit crude but should handle the most common cases. For cases which fall outside of this you can just use `document.querySelector` directly and provide the element as the argument.

```javascript
el(document.querySelector('some query'))
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`String` arguments provided as `children` are appended as text nodes
```javascript
el(h1, 'hello world')
```
```html
<h1 class="h1">hello world</h1>
```
`Element` arguments are just appended directly
```javascript
el(h1, document.createElement('div'))
```
```html
<h1 class="h1"><div></div></h1>
```
Since `el` itself returns elements, this allows nesting of `el` calls to declaratively create the DOM

```javascript
el(document.body,
  el('main', 
    el('h1', 'Title Text'),
    el('p', 'Paragraph text'),
  )
)
```
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 class="h1">Title Text</h1>
    <p class="p">Paragraph text</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Function` arguments are run in the context of the parent. This allows arbitrary manipulation of the parent such as attaching listeners, setting styles, etc 

```javascript
el('h1', function() {
  this.id = 'foo'
  this.onClick = () => console.log('clicked!')
  this.style.color = 'red'
})
```
```html
<h1 class="h1" id="foo"></h1>
```

The parent is also provided as the first argument to the function when it is called. This allows [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) to work

```javascript
el('h1', x => {
  x.id = 'foo'
  x.onClick = () => console.log('clicked!')
  x.style.color = 'red'
})
```
```html
<h1 class="h1" id="foo"></h1>
```
If the function returns a value, that value is appended as a child
```javascript
el('h1', 
  x => {
    return 'some text'
  }, 
  x => ' more text'
)
```
```html
<h1 class="h1">some text more text</h1>
```

The `attr(attribute, value)` function is provided as a shorthand for 
```javascript
$ => { $.setAttribute(attribute, value) }
```
This allows easy setting of attributes like this 
```javascript
el('h1', attr('id', 'foo'))
```
```html
<h1 class="h1" id="foo"></h1>
```

Similarly the `bind(reactor, value)` function is provided as a shorthand for 
```javascript
$ => {
  $.oninput = () => { reactor[key] = $.value }
  return new Observer(() => { $.value = reactor[key] })
}
```
This allows for easy 2-way binding for input fields and `Reactor` objects

```javascript
const rx = new Reactor({ name: 'foo' })
el('input', bind(rx, 'name'))
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Array` arguments are flattened and its elements recursively appended

```javascript
el('h1',[
  'some text',
  document.createElement('div'),
  x => 'boop'
])
```
```html
<h1 class="h1">some text<div></div>boop</h1>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Promise` arguments create a comment placeholder.
```javascript
let somePromise = new Promise()
el('h1', somePromise)
```
```html
<h1 class="h1"><!-- promisePlaceholder --></h1>
```
When the promise resolves this placeholder is replaced with the resolved value
```javascript
somePromise.resolve('resolved!')
```
```html
<h1 class="h1">resolved!</h1>
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Observer` functions from Elemental are handled very similarly to functions. They are executed in the context of the parent. However they also leave a set of comments bookmarking the children they produce.

```javascript
const rx = new Reactor({ name: 'foo' })
el('h1', ob(() => rx.name ))
```
```html
<h1 class="h1">
  <!-- observerStart -->
  foo
  <!-- observerEnd -->
</h1>
```

When the observer is retriggered, everything between the bookmarks is removed and replaced with the new output


```javascript
rx.name = 'bar'
```
```html
<h1 class="h1">
  <!-- observerStart -->
  bar
  <!-- observerEnd -->
</h1>
```

Read below for more details on how observers work

Note: for observers attached as children via `el` they are deactivated automatically when their parent is not attached to the document. This should not affect most use cases since the observer is reactivated when the parent is reattached to the document. But note that unattached elements just being held in memory will not be changing.

Reactors
--------

A `Reactor` is an object wrapper which automatically tracks `Observer` functions that read its properties and notifies the observers when those properties are updated.

You create a new reactor by just calling its constructor.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor()
```

You can also wrap an existing object with a reactor by passing it to the constructor. Changes to the reactor are passed through to the underlying object.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({
  foo: "bar"
})
```

Reactors behave mostly like plain javascript objects.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({
  foo: "bar"
})
// You can get and set properties as usual
reactor.foo // "bar"
reactor.cow = "moo"
// defineProperty works normally as well
Object.defineProperty(reactor, "milk", {
  get() { return "chocolate" }
})
reactor.milk // "chocolate"
// delete works too
delete reactor.foo
reactor.foo // undefined
```

The key difference of `Reactor` objects is that they track when one of their properties is read by an `Observer` function and will notify that observer when the property is updated.

```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({ foo: "bar" })

new Observer(() => {
  console.log("foo is ", reactor.foo)
})() // prints "foo is bar"

reactor.foo = "moo" // prints "foo is moo"

Object.defineProperty(reactor, "foo", {
  get() { return "meow" }
}) // prints "foo is meow"

delete reactor.foo // prints "foo is undefined"
```

Tracking is property specific so observers will not trigger if a different property is updated
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({
  foo: "bar",
  moo: "mar"
})

new Observer(() => {
  console.log("foo tracker is now", reactor.foo)
})() // prints "foo tracker is now bar"

new Observer(() => {
  console.log("moo tracker is now", reactor.moo)
})() // prints "moo tracker is now mar"

reactor.foo = "bar2" // prints "foo tracker is now bar2"
reactor.moo = "mar2" // prints "moo tracker is now mar2"
reactor.goo = "goop" // does not trigger any observers
```

If reading a reactor's property also returns an object, that object is recursively also wrapped in a reactor before being returned. This allows observers to tracks dependencies in nested objects easily.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({
  outer: {
    inner: "cake"
  }
})

new Observer(() => {
  console.log("inner value is ", reactor.outer.inner)
})() // prints "inner value is cake"
```

Reactors are implemented using [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) objects. This means reactors created from scratch typecheck as Reactors, but Reactors created from an existing object typecheck as the original object.

```javascript
const baseReactor = new Reactor()
baseReactor instanceof Reactor // true
const mapReactor = new Reactor(new Map())
mapReactor instanceof Reactor // false
mapReactor instanceof Map // true
```

This also has implications for native objects or objects which use private properties. Since proxies can't access native or private properties, some methods will fail. To get around this, we provide the `shuck` function which returns a reactor's internal object.

```javascript
// Native object example
const mapReactor = new Reactor(new Map())
Map.prototype.keys.apply(mapReactor) // throws an error
Map.prototype.keys.apply(shuck(mapReactor)) // works fine
```

Observers
---------

An `Observer` is like a normal function that you can define and call. When an `Observer` reads from a `Reactor` it automatically tracks that dependency, and when that reactor's property is updated it automatically triggers the observer again.

`Observer` functions are created by passing a function to its constructor.
```javascript
const observer = new Observer(() => {
  console.log("hello world")
})
observer() // prints "hello world" and starts the observer
```

For brevity observers can also be created and instantly executed like this
```javascript
new Observer(() => {
  console.log("hello world")
})() // prints "hello world" and starts the observer
```

For further simplicity the shorthand `ob` is also provided that is equivalent to `new Observer`
```javascript
ob(() => {
  console.log("hello world")
})() // prints "hello world" and starts the observer
```

When an `Observer` reads a `Reactor` property it gets saved as a dependent. When that property is updated it notifies the observer which reruns its function. This happens automatically without any need to manually declare dependencies.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor()
new Observer(() => {
  console.log("reactor.foo is ", reactor.foo)
})() // prints "reactor.foo is undefined"

reactor.foo = "bar" // prints "reactor.foo is bar"
```

An observer's dependencies are dynamically determined. Only the dependencies actually read in the last execution of an observer can trigger it again. This means that Reactor reads that are only conditionally used will not trigger the observer unnecessarily.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({
  a: true,
  b: "bee",
  c: "cee"
})
new Observer(() => {
  if (reactor.a) {
    console.log("reactor.b is ", reactor.b)
  } else {
    console.log("reactor.c is ", reactor.c)
  }
})() // prints "reactor.b is bee"

reactor.b = "boop" // prints "reactor.b is boop"
reactor.c = "cat" // does not trigger the observer

reactor.a = false // prints "reactor.c is cat"
reactor.b = "blue" // does not trigger the observer
reactor.c = "cheese" // prints "reactor.c is cheese"
```

An observer's results are themselves observable via either the `value` property, or by triggering the observer via `observer()` and using the return value. This allows you to chain observers together.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({ foo: 'bar' })
const capitalizer = new Observer(() => {
  return reactor.foo.toUpperCase()
})()
const printer = new Observer(() => {
  console.log(capitalizer.value)
})() // prints 'BAR'
reactor.foo = 'baz' // Prints 'BAZ'
```

This works too:
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({ foo: 'bar' })
const capitalizer = new Observer(() => {
  return reactor.foo.toUpperCase()
}) // Did not start the observer here
const printer = new Observer(() => {
  // Manually calls capitalizer like a function which actives it
  // As well as accesses its return value as a dependency
  console.log(capitalizer()) 
})() // Starts printer which starts capitalizer
reactor.foo = 'baz' // Prints 'BAZ'
```

You can stop an observer by just calling `stop()` on the returned observer object. This clears any existing dependencies and prevents triggering. You can restart the observer by just calling `start()`. Starting is idempotent so calling `start()` on an already running observer will have no effect.
```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor()
const observer = new Observer(() => {
  console.log(reactor.foo)
})() // prints "undefined"

reactor.foo = "bar" // prints "bar"

observer.stop()

reactor.foo = "cheese" // does not trigger the observer

observer.start() // prints "cheese"
observer.start() // No effect
observer.start() // No effect
observer.start() // No effect

reactor.foo = "moo" // prints "moo"
```

For convenience, you can call an observer to execute like a normal function. This works regardless of whether the observer is stopped. Doing so starts the observer up again.

```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({ foo: "hello" })
const observer = new Observer(() => {
  console.log(reactor.foo)
})() // prints "hello"
reactor.foo = "hi" // prints "hi"
observer() // prints "hi" again

observer.stop()
reactor.foo = "hola" // does not trigger the observer since its stopped
observer() // prints "hola"
```

Like normal functions, observers can expect and be called with arguments. They remember the arguments from the last time they were called and reuse them when automatically triggered.

```javascript
const parameterizedObserver = new Observer((arg1, arg2) => {
  console.log(reactor.foo + arg1 + arg2)
})
parameterizedObserver('beep', 'bop') // Prints bazbeepbop
reactor.foo = 'bla' // Prints blabeepbop
```

Observers can also use and remember the last `this` context. Note that just like normal functions, for the `this` context to be bound to the holding object, it needs to be defined with the traditional `function` keyboard instead of es6 arrow functions. 
```javascript
const holdingObject = {
  name: 'Mario',
  greet: new Observer(function () { // Need to use of `function`
    console.log("Hello " + reactor.foo + " itsa me " +  this.name)
  })
}
holdingObject.greet() // Prints "Hello bla itsa me Mario"
reactor.foo = 'bonk' // Prints "Hello bonk itsa me Mario"
holdingObject.name = 'Luigi' // Prints nothing since holdingObject is not a Reactor
```


### Hide

Sometimes you might want to read from a reactor without becoming dependent on it. A common case for this is when using array modification methods. These often also read from the array in order to do the modification.
```javascript
const taskList = new Reactor(["a", "b", "c", "d"])

// Creating the following observer will throw a LoopError
// Because it both reads from and modifies the length property of taskList
// As a result it triggers itself in the middle of execution
// This loop is detected and creates an exception
new Observer(() => {
  // Even though we only want to modify the array
  // pop() also reads the length property of the array
  console.log(taskList.pop()) 
})()
```

In these cases you can use "hide" to shield a block of code from creating dependencies. It takes a function and any reactor properties read inside that function will not be set as dependencies. `hide` also passes through the return value of its function for syntactic simplicity.
```javascript
const taskList = new Reactor(["a", "b", "c", "d"])

new Observer(() => {

  console.log(
    // Because we wrap pop() call in an hide block
    // It is not create a depndency on the length property
    // Unlike our previous example
    hide(() => taskList.pop())
  ) 

})() // prints "d"

taskList.push("e") // does not trigger the observer
```

Note that only the reads inside the hide block are shielded from creating dependencies. The rest of the observe block still creates dependencies as normal.

### Overrides
If you need to access the raw function the observer is wrapping you do so with the `execute` property.

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {}
const observer = new Observer(myFunction)
myFunction === observer.execute // true
```

By setting this property you can change an observers internal logic. Doing so clears dependencies and retriggers the observer. Note that the previous `this` and arguments contexts will stay. 

```javascript
const reactor = new Reactor({ foo: "bar" })
let observerToBeOverriden = new Observer((arg) => {
  console.log(reactor.foo, 'and', arg)
})
observerToBeOverriden('blap') // prints "bar and blap"
reactor.foo = "moo" // prints "moo and blap"

// Setting the execute property replaces the old function
observerToBeOverriden.execute = (arg) => {
  console.log("I am saying", arg, reactor.foo)
} // prints "I am saying blap moo"
reactor.foo = "blep" // prints "I am saying blap blep"
```

### Batching
One problem with automatic watchers is that you might end up with multiple repeated triggering when you're updating a whole lot of information all at once. The following code shows an example where you want to update multiple properties, but each property update prematurely triggers the observer since you are not done updating yet.

```javascript
const person = new Reactor({ 
  firstName: "Anakin",
  lastName: "Skywalker",
  faction: "Jedi",
  rank: "Knight"
})

// This observer tracks multiple properties 
// and so will be triggered when any of the properties get updated
const observer = new Observer(() => {
  console.log(
    "I am " +
    person.firstName + 
    " " + 
    person.lastName + 
    ", " + 
    person.faction + 
    " " + 
    person.rank
  )
})() // prints "I am Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight"

// The following updates will each trigger the observer even though we only 
// want to trigger the observer once all the updates are complete
person.firstName = "Darth" // prints "I am Darth Skywalker, Jedi Knight"
person.lastName = "Vader" // prints "I am Darth Vader, Jedi Knight"
person.faction = "Sith" // prints "I am Darth Vader, Sith Knight"
person.rank = "Lord" // prints "I am Darth Vader, Sith Lord"
```

The `batch` function is provided to allow you to batch multiple updates together and only trigger the appropriate observers once at the end of the batch block. So the last part of the previous example can be turned into:
```javascript
// batch postpones any observer triggers that originate from inside it
// Triggers are deduplicated so any observer is triggered at most once
batch(() => {
  // None of the following updates will trigger the observer yet
  person.firstName = "Darth" 
  person.lastName = "Vader"
  person.faction = "Sith"
  person.rank = "Lord"
}) // prints "I am Darth Vader, Sith Lord"
```

This is useful when you are making multiple data updates and want to avoid showing an "incomplete" view of the data to observers.

Note that only the observer triggering is postponed till the end. The actual reactor propertes are updated in place as expected. This means that you can have other logic with read-what-you-write semantics within the observer block working just fine.

el('h1', self => {
  self.oninput = () => { rx['foo'] = self.value }
  return new Observer(() => { self.value = rx['foo'] })
})

// ob is shorthand for creating Observers
// These 2 are equivalent
ob(function(){})
new Observer(function(){})

// Reactors and Observers
const reactor = new Reactor({ foo: 'bar' })
const observer = new Observer(() => {
  const result = 'reactor.foo is ' + reactor.foo // Sets a dependency on foo
  console.log(result) 
  return result
})
observer() // Prints 'reactor.foo is bar' and starts the observer
reactor.foo = 'baz' // Prints 'reactor.foo is baz'

observer.stop()
reactor.foo = 'qux' // Prints nothing since observer is stopped

observer.start() // Prints 'reactor.foo is baz'
observer.start() // Prints nothing since observer is already started
observer() // Prints 'reactor.foo is baz' even if it is already running

// Observers return values are themselves observable
const trailingObserver = new Observer(() => {

reactor.foo = 'bonk' // Prints "Hello bonk itsa me Mario"
holdingObject.name = 'Luigi' // Prints nothing since holdingObject is not a Reactor

// hide allows you to avoid particular dependencies in an observer
// This is useful especially when using Array methods that both read and write
reactor.ticker = 1
reactor.names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charles", "David"]
const partialObserver = new Observer(() => {
  if (reactor.ticker) {
    // hide passes through the return value of its block
    const next = hide(() => reactor.names.pop())
    console.log("next ", next)
  }
})
partialObserver() // prints "next David"
reactor.ticker = 2 // prints "next Charles"
reactor.names.push("Elsie") // Will not trigger the observer

// batch postpones any observer triggers until it is complete
// This allows grouping updates together
const person = new Reactor({
  firstName: 'Clark',
  lastName: 'Kent'
})
new Observer(() => {
  console.log('Look its ' + person.firstName + ' ' + person.lastName)
})() // Prints 'Look its Clark Kent'
batch(() => {
  // None of the following updates will trigger the observer yet
  person.firstName = "Bruce" 
  person.lastName = "Wayne"
}) // prints 'Look its Bruce Wayne'

// shuck removes the Reactor layer and returns the base object
// This is necessary for some native objects which dont work with proxies
const mapReactor = new Reactor(new Map())
Map.prototype.keys.call(mapReactor) // throws an Error
Map.prototype.keys.call(shuck(mapReactor)) // works fine
```
